                At Light Junior Academy, we believe in a well-rounded education where <strong>extracurricular activities</strong> play a vital role in student development. These activities, including <strong>sports, music, drama, and clubs</strong>, allow students to explore their talents and interests. Active participation also contributes to <strong>personal growth, team-building, and academic performance</strong>. However, it is important for students to maintain a balance between their <strong>extracurricular pursuits</strong> and <strong>academic responsibilities</strong>.

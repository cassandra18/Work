            Welcome to our vibrant and forward-thinking CBC Primary and Junior
            Secondary School here in the heart of Kericho. At our school, we
            believe in nurturing every child's potential through a holistic and

            values in a supportive and inclusive environment.

            With a team of dedicated, professionally trained teachers and a
            focus on individualized attention, we ensure that no child is left
            behind. Our modern facilities, digital learning tools, and active
            co-curricular programs help develop well-rounded learners who are
            not only academically strong but also socially and emotionally
